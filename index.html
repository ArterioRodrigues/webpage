                            Have you ever been outside and you really needed to use the bathroom? Or that you didn't know that you had to buy something before using the bathroom? 
                            Or if you walked into a really gross bathroom? Well- this app we built could help with that!
                            <br/>
                            The Toicator is a maps tool for users to find the nearest bathroom and filter their choices
                            based on cleanliness, proof of purchase requirement, single stalled or multi-stalled.
                            <br/><br/>
                            This app used Swift, Googles Maps, and Firebase.

                            This is a python program that predicts upto 60 days for a given stock market ticker closing prices. The project used an LSTM model to make the prediction.
                            The model was built on MSFT closing data from as far back as 2000-01-01 in which 80% of the data was used for predicting the other 20%. The data set was 
                            transfored using scaler transform to account for a faster run time and easier computation. Once the model was created it was used to predict APPLE stock 
                            for 60 days with a given error range of 8%. <br/><br/>
                            This app used python, machine learning with tensorflow, matplotlib, numpy, and data collection with yfinance.
